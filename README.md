🚀 Project Highlight: Amazon Sales Data Analytics – From Raw Data to Business Insights
🔍 Overview:
This end-to-end data analytics project dissects Amazon's sales performance across regions, categories, and time periods—transforming raw transactional data into actionable business insights using Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.

🧠 What I Did:
🔹 Cleaned and structured messy sales data using Excel
🔹 Performed deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
🔹 Queried and aggregated sales trends with MySQL
🔹 Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs)

✅ Month-over-month and year-over-year sales growth
✅ Top-performing products, categories, and cities
✅ Profitability analysis by region and product line
✅ Identification of sales anomalies and seasonal trends

In real business environments, sales data is often messy, high-volume, and underutilized. This project simulates a real-world scenario, showing how data-driven decisions can be made by combining the strengths of multiple tools across the analytics lifecycle.

🛠️ Tools Used:
-Excel for data preprocessing
-Python for data wrangling and visualization
